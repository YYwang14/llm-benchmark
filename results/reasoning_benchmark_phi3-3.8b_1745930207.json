      "prompt": "Four friends (Alex, Blake, Casey, and Dana) are sitting in a row at a movie theater. Alex is not sitting next to Blake. Casey is sitting next to Dana. Blake is sitting at one of the ends. Who is sitting next to Blake?",
      "response": "Since there are four friends seated in a single-file line and we know that Alex cannot sit next to Blake, it means either Casey or Dana must be on either side of Blake since they're not mentioned as being restricted. Furthermore, the additional information tells us that Casey is sitting next to Dana but does not specify their exact position in relation to each other; however, we do know for certain where one end sits (Blake). Given these constraints and knowing there are only two spots adjacent to Blake at an ends of a row:\n\n1. If Blake is seated on the left-hand end, then Dana must be sitting next to him because Casey has to sit next to Dana but cannot also directly follow or precede Alex as they can't both occupy that single spot by rule one (Alex isn\u2019t allowed beside Blake). Thus in this scenario, it would place Alex on the far right:\n   - Seating order from left to right is: Blake, Dana, Casey.\n   \n2. Conversely, if we assume Blake sits at the right-hand end for variety's sake (although he\u2019s not supposedly seated in that position), this would place Alex next on his immediate right and consequently put him beside himself which contradicts rule one; therefore, it is impossible here.\n\nThus based only on provided information: Dana must be sitting to the left of Blake since Casey can't sit directly next due to a lack of explicit positioning details regarding them being together aside from their relation with each other and Alex (as they cannot occupy that single spot).",

      "response": "Firstly, order your purchase from lowest to highest price: Shirt A ($20), Shirt B ($25), Shirt C ($30). Because of the deal, you would get a discount on Shirt C. Thus, calculate half its cost (i.curent_price) which is $15.\nNow add up your purchase costs: \nShirt A's price =$20  \nShirt B's price=$25   \nDiscounted price for shirt C= $15    \nTotal Price of all three items = Shirt_A + Shirt_B + Discounted_C     \n                                = $20 + $25+ 15  \n                                =$60.

      "response": "Let C represent the set of cat owners (C = 85%) and D represent the set of dog owners (D = 75%). We want to find |C \u2229 D|, which represents those who own both. By using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\nP(C \u222a D) = P(C) + P(D) - P(C \u2229 D)\n\nWe know that 5% have neither cats nor dogs, so this means they are not part of C or D (i.e., their union is equal to the total population):\nP((C \u222a D)^c) = 100% - 95% = 5%\n\nUsing De Morgan's Law: P(C^c \u2229 D^c) = P((C \u222a D)^c) => (100% - |C|)(100% - |D|) = 5%\n=> (100% - 85%) * (100% - 75%) = 5%\n=> 15% * 25% = 3.75% => P(C^c \u2229 D^c) = 3.75%\n\nNow, we can use this result to find the percentage of residents who have both cats and dogs:\nP(C \u2229 D) = P(C) + P(D) - P(C \u222a D) = 85% + 75% - (100% - 3.75%) = 68.75%",

      "prompt": "If water were not a polar molecule, how would this affect its ability to dissolve salt?",
      "response": "Water's solvency for salts primarily hinges on hydrogen bonding capabilities and the ion-dipole interactions that occur because of its polar nature. If we entertain an imaginative scenario where water is nonpolar, it would lack a significant dipole moment to engage with positively charged sodium ions (Na+) or negatively charged chloride ions (Cl-) effectively.\n\nIn this alternate reality, without the ability to form strong interactions through hydrogen bonding and ion-dipole forces due to its nonpolarity, water would be much less effective in solvating salt because it could not separate into individual sodium and chloride ions as efficiently as it does when dissolving common table salt (sodium chloride). The result is a higher concentration of undissolved salt at the bottom of any container with nonpolar water, much like one would observe in oil-water mixtures.\n\nThis hypothetical scenario underscores just how crucial hydrogen bonding and dipole interactions are for solubility processes involving salts like sodium chloride in our world's polar solvent \u2013 water.",
