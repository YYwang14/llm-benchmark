      "response": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Alex is not sitting next to Blake.\n2. Casey is sitting next to Dana.\n3. Blake is sitting at one of the ends.\n\nFrom point 2, we know that Casey and Dana are sitting together. Since there are only four friends in total, this means that either Alex or Blake must be sitting between Casey and Dana.\n\nSince Alex is not sitting next to Blake (point 1), it means that Alex must be sitting between Casey and Dana. This would mean that Dana is sitting on one end, followed by Casey and then Alex, and finally the other end, which is occupied by... Blake!\n\nSo, the answer is: Alex is sitting next to Blake.",

      "response": "Let's figure out which shirt is the cheapest. The cheapest is the $20 shirt. Then we get the $20 shirt for half off of $20, which is $10. So we are paying 2 * ($20 + $25 + $30) - $10 = 2*75-$10 = $140-$10 = $130. The answer is $130.",

      "prompt": "In a small town, 85% of the residents have cats, 75% have dogs, and 5% have neither cats nor dogs. What percentage of the town's residents have both cats and dogs?",
      "response": "Let $x$ be the total number of people in the town. Then $0.85x$ have cats, $0.75x$ have dogs, and $0.05x$ have neither cats nor dogs. This means that $0.15x$ do not have cats, so $0.7x$ have cats. Similarly, $0.25x$ do not have dogs, so $0.7x$ have dogs.\n\nIf we let $y$ be the percentage of people who have both, then $$0.85x - y = 0.7x \\text{ and } 0.75x - y = 0.7x.$$ Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us\n\n$$0.10x = y \\Rightarrow \\boxed{y=10\\%}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct.",

      "prompt": "If water were not a polar molecule, how would this affect its ability to dissolve salt?",
      "response": "Water's polarity plays a crucial role in its ability to dissolve salts. If water were not a polar molecule, it would significantly impact its ability to dissolve salts. Here's what would happen:\n\n1. **Reduced solubility**: Without polarity, water molecules (H2O) wouldn't be able to form hydrogen bonds with ions like sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-), which are essential for dissolving salts. This means that the solubility of salts in non-polar water would be significantly lower.\n2. **No ion-dipole interactions**: In polar water, the partially positive hydrogen atoms (H+) form weak bonds with negatively charged ions like Cl-. These interactions help to stabilize the dissolved ions and facilitate their dissolution. Without polarity, these interactions wouldn't occur, making it even harder for salts to dissolve.\n3. **Increased lattice energy**: The attraction between positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions is strong in ionic solids like common table salt (sodium chloride). In non-polar water, this attraction would be greater due to the absence of hydrogen bonding, making it more difficult for the ions to break free from each other.\n4. **Different dissolution mechanisms**: Non-polar solvents typically use different dissolution mechanisms, such as dispersion forces or van der Waals interactions, which are weaker than the electrostatic interactions between ions in polar water.\n\nAs a result:\n\n* Salts like sodium chloride (NaCl) would have much lower solubility in non-polar water.\n* Other salts, like calcium carbonate (CaCO3), might not dissolve at all without polarity.\n* New dissolution mechanisms or additives might be needed to facilitate the dissolution of salts in non-polar water.\n\nIt's important to note that this hypothetical scenario assumes a complete absence of polarity in water. In reality, some degree of polarity always exists in water due to the unequal sharing of electrons between hydrogen and oxygen atoms.",
