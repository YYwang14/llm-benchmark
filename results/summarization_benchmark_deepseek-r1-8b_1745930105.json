      "prompt": "Summarize the following text in 2-3 sentences:\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans. AI research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. The term 'artificial intelligence' had previously been used to describe machines that mimic and display human cognitive skills that are associated with the human mind, such as learning and problem-solving. This definition has since been rejected by major AI researchers who now describe AI in terms of rationality and acting rationally, which does not limit how intelligence can be articulated. AI applications include advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, voice assistants, and self-driving cars. As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require 'intelligence' are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.",
      "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to summarize this text about artificial intelligence in 2-3 sentences. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the key points.\n\nThe text starts by defining AI as machine-based intelligence, differentiating it from natural intelligence in animals, including humans. It mentions that AI research is about intelligent agents, which are systems that perceive their environment and take actions to achieve goals. Then, it talks about how the term 'AI' was originally used to describe machines mimicking human cognitive skills like learning and problem-solving, but this definition has been rejected by some researchers. Instead, they now focus on AI as a form of rationality without limiting how intelligence is expressed. The applications listed are web search engines, recommendation systems, voice assistants, and self-driving cars. There's also the concept of the AI effect, where tasks seen as intelligent are excluded from AI definitions as machines become more capable.\n\nSo, I need to condense all that into 2-3 sentences without losing the main ideas: what AI is, its focus on rationality, common applications, and the AI effect.\n\nI should start by defining AI clearly. Then mention the shift in definition from mimicking human intelligence to a broader concept of rationality. Include examples of applications like voice assistants and self-driving cars. Finally, touch upon the AI effect where tasks requiring intelligence are excluded as machines become more advanced.\n\nLet me try putting that together concisely.\n</think>\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) refers to machine-based intelligence, distinguishing it from natural intelligence in animals. It focuses on creating intelligent agents that perceive environments and achieve goals through rationality rather than merely mimicking human cognitive skills. Applications include advanced technologies like voice assistants, self-driving cars, and recommendation systems. The AI effect arises as tasks deemed intelligent are excluded from AI definitions as machines grow more capable.",
