      "reference_answer": "Casey",
      "explanation": "If Blake is at one end, and Alex is not next to Blake, then either Casey or Dana must be next to Blake. Since Casey is sitting next to Dana, they must be in the middle two seats. So if Blake is at one end, and Alex can't be next to Blake, then Alex must be at the other end. This means the order is either Blake, Casey, Dana, Alex or Alex, Dana, Casey, Blake. In either case, Casey is next to Blake.",

      "reference_answer": "$65",
      "explanation": "The cheapest item is the $20 shirt, which gets a 50% discount. So you pay full price for the $25 and $30 shirts, and half price for the $20 shirt. This gives: $25 + $30 + ($20/2) = $25 + $30 + $10 = $65.",

      "reference_answer": "65%",
      "explanation": "Let's use the formula for union of sets: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B). We know that P(A ∪ B) = 1 - P(neither) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95, where A is the set of people with cats and B is the set of people with dogs. So, 0.95 = 0.85 + 0.75 - P(A ∩ B). Solving for P(A ∩ B), we get P(A ∩ B) = 0.85 + 0.75 - 0.95 = 0.65, or 65%.",

      "explanation": "This is a classic syllogism. If all mammals are warm-blooded (major premise) and all whales are mammals (minor premise), then it logically follows that all whales are warm-blooded (conclusion).",

      "reference_answer": "If water were not polar, it would be much less effective at dissolving salt (sodium chloride). The polarity of water molecules allows them to surround and separate the Na+ and Cl- ions in salt. Without this polarity, water would not be able to overcome the strong ionic bonds in salt, and salt would be much less soluble in water.",
