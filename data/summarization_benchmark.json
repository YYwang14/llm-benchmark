AI research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. The term 'artificial intelligence' had previously been used to describe machines that mimic and display human cognitive skills that are associated with the human mind, such as learning and problem-solving. This definition has since been rejected by major AI researchers who now describe AI in terms of rationality and acting rationally, which does not limit how intelligence can be articulated. AI applications include advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, voice assistants, and self-driving cars. As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require 'intelligence' are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.",
